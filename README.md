# Vision_Based_UDA

This project evaluates the robustness of ViT-based UDA models under patch-wise adversarial attacks. We adapt the Patch-Fool framework by selecting attention-based transferable patches instead of confidence-drop regions, enabling targeted domain attacks.

Note: The research is going on. 

# Acknowledgement

Our code is largely borrowed from Vit-Pytorch and other various open source codes.
